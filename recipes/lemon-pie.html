        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the dough:
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix the cold butter (previously cut in small cubes)
                        with the sugar and flour, without heating it up too
                        much, until you've got a grainy texture</li>
                    <li>Add the yolks, vanilla and lemon cest. Mix until
                        it's homogeneous.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with film, let it rest in the fridge
                        at least 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Take the cold dough and make a ball, sprinkle the
                        table with flour and stretch the dough in a circle
                        4mm thick</li>
                    <li>Roll the stretched dough on top of the mold, making
                        it take its shape, taking special care on the edges
                        of the pan. Let it rest at least 30 minutes in the
                        fridge before baking.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>For the lemon filling:
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the milk with half the sugar on a pot and bring
                        to the heat.</li>
                    <li>Place the previously sieved corn starch in a bowl
                        along with the rest of the sugar, the egg yolks,
                        the lemon juice and zest , and half of the hot milk,
                        mix and leave the other half on the heat. When the 
                        rest of the milk boils, pour the yolk mixture over 
                        it, cook while continuously mixing and once it 
                        starts to boil again cook for 1 more minute 
                        until thickened.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the heat and add the butter, 
                        mix and let it cool.</li>
                </ol>

            </li>

            <li>For the swiss meringue:
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the egg whites with the sugar over a bain-marie 
                        to 45°C, stirring constantly, then remove from heat 
                        and beat until firm peaks form. Add a squeeze of 
                        lemon juice that will only contribute to making the 
                        meringue whiter and shinier.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Putting it all together:
                <ol>
                    <li>Prick the cold tart with a fork so that the dough 
                    does not swell, then cover with aluminum foil, 
                    copying the shape of the dough and fill the mold 
                    with ceramic balls or beans. (the extra weight 
                    will prevent the dough from deforming in the bake)
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 170ºC for 15 minutes, 
                        until it takes on a slightly toasted color.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Once the lemon filling is cooler, pour it over the cake.</li>
                    <li>Cover the lemon filling with the meringue.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Presentation:
                <ol>
                    <li>Sprinkle the meringue with sugar and burn with a blowtorch.</li> 
                    <li>Cut into portions.</li>
                </ol>
